By considering only spherical likelihoods and priors L(r) and P(r), and
requiring the L(r) is a monotinically decreasing function of the radius r
(i.e. that the likelihood increases as r decreases to a maximum at r=0)
we ensure all iso-likelihood contours are hyperspherical shells.

al. 2017) and "Dynamic nested sampling: an improved algorithm for nested
sampling parameter estimation and evidence calculation" (Higson et al.
2017).
